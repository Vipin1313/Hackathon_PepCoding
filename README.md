# Hackathon_PepCoding
 I have made #Travel_Tour_Guide an automation project using #puppeteer for hackathon organized by Pepcoding Education Private Limited.  User can enter their source, Destination and Date of Travel. Then it will automatically:-  >> Open IRCTC official website >> Enter source, destination &amp; Date of Travel >> Search for available trains >> Scrape all details of available trains >> Then it will redirect to Redbus.in  >> Enter source, destination &amp; Date of Travel >> Search for available buses >> Scrape all details of available buses >> Then it will redirect to travellook.in  >> Enter source, destination &amp; Date of Travel >> Search for available flights >> Scrape all details of available flights >> Then it will create a new text file with details of all available buses, trains and flights from source to destination.
