# Hackathon_PepCoding
I have made #Travel_Tour_Guide an automation project using #puppeteer for hackathon organized by Pepcoding Education Private Limited.
User can enter their source, Destination and Date of Travel. Then it will automatically:-  

>> Open IRCTC official website 
>> Enter source, destination &amp; Date of Travel 
>> Search for available trains 
>> Scrape all details of available trains 
>> Then it will redirect to Redbus.in  
>> Enter source, destination &amp; Date of Travel 
>> Search for available buses >> Scrape all details of available buses 
>> Then it will redirect to travellook.in  
>> Enter source, destination &amp; Date of Travel 
>> Search for available flights 
>> Scrape all details of available flights 
>> Then it will create a new text file with details of all available buses, trains and flights from source to destination.
 
 
Future Scope :- 
>> An amazing UI can be created so that user can easiy compare between different modes of travel and can choose one
>> More information can be scraped such as seat availability, class wise fares etc.
>> More filters can be applied as per users choice such as cheapest mode of travel, shortest mode of travel etc.
